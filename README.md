## Course Description

In this scenario-driven course, learn how to build an AI-powered pre-sales agent using n8n and a large language model (LLM) of your choice. Tobias Zwingmann—a managing partner at RAPYD.AI, an AI consulting firm—takes you through how to design a bot that starts small, having access to just a single tool. Then, take your agent to the next level, so it can not only recommend suitable products, but also calculate offers based on a custom pricing mechanic, create offer documents from internal templates, and even prepare emails that are ready to be sent out to prospects. Along the way, Tobias ensures that you’re not just learning tools—you’re solving real-world challenges. After finishing this course, you’ll be familiar with the core concepts of building custom AI agents in n8n and what it takes to move toward production-ready deployment. Whether you’re a software developer or a tech-savvy business professional, this course offers a quick start in building practical, high-impact AI agents.
